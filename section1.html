	            The unconscious Future of <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  planets and nations <br/> &emsp; &emsp; has little bearing on <br/> &emsp; &emsp; my personal Walkabout, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; except for the iron, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; circadian ebb and ﬂow   <br/> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; of inner tides. <br> <br> What I mean by Future <br/> &emsp; &emsp; is my own feather palace <br/> &emsp; &emsp; in the winds of history, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; freely chosen and held <br/> &emsp; &emsp; together by the spit of <br/> &emsp; &emsp; Will and the rudder and <br/> &emsp; &emsp; jib of Dreams. <br><br> When Imagination slid between <br/> &emsp; &emsp; the legs of Purpose, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; the progeny was the Future, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; and her birthing occurred <br/> &emsp; &emsp; on a detrital, distant shore <br/> &emsp; &emsp; of the Present, where an <br/> &emsp; &emsp; ashen mist spiraled into <br/> &emsp; &emsp; phantasmagoric forms under <br/> &emsp; &emsp; which tongues I folded the <br/> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; messages of Life.

	            From the nigritude of the closet <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  in the cellar of my soul, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  let me call forth ﬁreﬂies <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  of personal light which will <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  dance little mazurkas of <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  hopeful life in the eternal <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  night which shrouds not only <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  our beginnings and ends, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  but also our childhoods <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  which were always so rich <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  and complex that when we <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  look back at them as adults, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  we wonder how we survived <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  the loneliness of our growth <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  and the sadness of our unspoken <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  and unsuspected dreams. <br> <br>The songs of youth are rich <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  and hollow. <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  they spring from the deepest <br/> &emsp; &emsp; reservoir of archetypal urgings, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  inspired by halluncinatory <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  hopes founded without precedents, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  -----growing in the shallowest pools <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  of callow knowledge  and <br/> &emsp; &emsp; innocuous faith. <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  Loved ones extend beckoning <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  arms and emit wonderfully warm, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  glaikit sounds as they eye our <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  ﬁrst toddling steps. <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  No one knows whether we <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  really ever will learn to walk. <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  let alone run, or race, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  or race to win. <br><br>
				Days are endless, seasons eternal, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  years epochal, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  vacations paradisical. <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  Then Eden seals over and eternity <br/> &emsp; &emsp; begins to ring on the hour. <br/> &emsp; &emsp; Goals are precisely attained, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  degrees achieved <br/> &emsp; &emsp; and careers launched, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  marriages joined <br/> &emsp; &emsp; and families dispersed, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; loves concluded <br/> &emsp; &emsp; and friendships faded, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  signiﬁcance surmounted <br/> &emsp; &emsp; and purpose dropped and lost <br/> &emsp; &emsp; in nostalgic places paved over <br/> &emsp; &emsp; long ago with cynicism <br/> &emsp; &emsp; and lit by other’s ﬁre. <br><br>The passionate matters of <br/> &emsp; &emsp; childhood pass like quicksilver <br/> &emsp; &emsp; between the cracks of <br/> &emsp; &emsp; maturity in the armor of <br/> &emsp; &emsp; children’s time, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; and we grow suddenly limp <br/> &emsp; &emsp; with the knowledge that <br/> &emsp; &emsp; what is left is only <br/> &emsp; &emsp; a matter of Art, Creativity, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; Loneliness, Love, and Death. <br><br>The old concept of eternity <br/> &emsp; &emsp; in the minds of youth, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; comes back at the end <br/> &emsp; &emsp; to haunt us in a big <br/> &emsp; &emsp; and ﬁnal way.

Thinking as if these were <br/> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; last thoughts, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;leading one to consider the <br/> &emsp; &emsp; usual mulling over of what might <br/> &emsp; &emsp; have been done differently; <br/> &emsp; &emsp; or maybe focusing upon one’s <br/> &emsp; &emsp; honorable accomplishments. <br> But what about a refulgent idea in the <br/> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; attic darkness, <br/> &emsp; &emsp;of a reformation of planning in <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; an innovative present, <br/> &emsp; &emsp; instead of rumination about a <br/> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  nostalgic past <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  or an ominous future? <br> Suppose one’s last line is: <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  “this is what I will do now!” <br/> &emsp; &emsp;  And then the staircase descends <br/> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  on its own.
